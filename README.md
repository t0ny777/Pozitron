## 📖 Project History & Context

This project represents my first end-to-end development of a published application. It was a significant undertaking that provided hands-on experience in:

- **Full Project Lifecycle:** Taking an idea from concept and design to development, publication, and maintenance
- **Complex Feature Integration:** Successfully combining authentication, a real-time database, cloud storage, and external APIs
- **Publication Process:** Navigating the entire process of publishing an app on the Google Play Store
- **Commercial Awareness:** Understanding the value of software, leading to a successful sale of the completed asset

This repository serves as a testament to my ability to complete and deliver complex projects.

## 🔍 Looking Back & Moving Forward

This project was an invaluable learning experience that laid the foundation for my current development practices. Working on it taught me crucial lessons about software architecture, the importance of clean code, and project management.

While the code here represents my skills from 2019, my current focus is on strengthening my backend capabilities with Spring Boot, modern design patterns, and building scalable systems, as demonstrated in my newer project, the [Investment Tracker](link-to-your-investment-tracker-repo).
